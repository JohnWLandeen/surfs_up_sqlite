## Summary

These statistics would seem to conclude that O'ahu has about a difference of 4 degrees between Summer and Winter. With the differences being universally slight of 4 degrees between the observation statistics for these two months, additional querries for confirmation of these findings may be ideal. With essentially the same querries focused on the station of greatest observation count, we have similar findings of small intervals of close to 3 degrees for interquartile ranges and the mean allongside a familiar difference of about 7 or 8 degrees for the minimum temperatures.
